      <img src="rb.jpg" style="width:20%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Library Management System specifically in borrowing of books is a program that maintains a system in the library. The system manages
      books information and a program that allows users to execute:
      Registration: Adding new user to the system which stores for each member identification number, name, address, street, city, phone number, age, and email address. Data is stored in a separate file in the same format of books file. 
      Search for a book: The system should process a request by the user to look up information about a specific entry. The user can supply book title, author name, ISBN or category which will then be provided by a list of books that matches the user request. 
      Add new copy: The system should prompt the administrator to enter book ISBN and the number of its copies and update the book entry in the file with the new number of copies.
      Delete book: The administrator should be prompted for the book ISBN and that entry should be deleted from the system (whenever books are obsolete). 
      Borrowing: For each member who borrows a book, the system stores book ISBN, user ID, date issued, date due to return, date returned. Again, all borrowing data should be stored into a separate file. Also the number of available copies for that book should be decremented. A member can not borrow more than 2 books at a time.
      Returning Book: When a user return a borrowed book back to the library, the entry for his borrowing action must be updated with the date returned. Also for book entry; the number of available copies of the book must be incremented.
      Remove Member: When a member wants to leave the system, the system must make sure that this user does not have any borrowed books">

      <img src="ps.jpg" style="width:20%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="The most common challenge for hospitals, their managers, and employees is to reduce operational costs and reach efficiency targets. Meanwhile, most hospitals operate with limited resources.

      Their quest to streamline the organization has traditionally prevented patients from moving comfortably throughout their visits and re-visits. Instead, patients are often placed in long waiting lines while receiving minimal information throughout their stay.
      
      A minor measure to overcome this problem is to invest in an appointment system. During the years, I’ve seen numerous improvements among hospitals that allow the patient to book appointments in advance. Below, I have summarized the main benefits of patient appointment systems in hospitals.">
      <img src="dependability.jpg" style="width:10%" onclick="onClick(this)" alt="Visiting a salon or spa without a prior appointment can keep you waiting in a queue and will take a lot of your precious time. To solve this, we have developed an advanced online salon & spa booking system using ASP.net that can help the users to book an appointment in their favorite salon or spa. The users can easily access the system by registering themselves on the website.

      The system will provide information on nearby salons/spas & their services. The users can view the salons’ facility, services & hair stylists’ reviews, and based on that they can choose the best salon with the beautician or hairstylists suited for them and book an appointment as per their desired time & date. The users can also purchase various beauty-related products online. The system will also allow the users to drop their feedback as well.">
